					<p>For varsity swimming, there are 3 levels of major competition to qualify for, in order of increasing difficulty: Leagues (everyone can participate), Counties, and States. While I didn't qualify for States, I was fast enough to qualify for Counties in both 10th and 11th grade (2018 and 2019), qualifying for 2 events (100 breaststroke, 200 IM) in 2018 and 3 events (100 breaststroke, 100 free, 200 IM) in 2019.</p>

					<p>Varsity Boys Swimming and Diving is a Varsity-level sport in our school that has always been fairly less known than the other Varsity sports, but just as competitive. I have been competing on the Varsity team since 10th grade, and for 12th grade, I was made one of the captains of the Varsity team, and I hope to increase the popularity of the sport as well as help others improve their swimming. </p>

					<p>I have been committed to swimming for a long time, as shown in my participation in TVSC, or Three Village Swim Club. I have been part of TVSC since 4th grade (2011-2012), and I have been improving myself at swimming for the years since. TVSC is an out-of-school swim club that meets 6 times a week for 1 hour to 2 hours each time (depending on what group you are in) during the school year and the summer, and TVSC swimmers compete in a wide range of USA Swimming-sanctioned meets ranging from local to national. I have moved up from the lowest group in TVSC (Novice BB) up to the highest rank (Seniors), which I moved up to in 9th grade. I have competed in many of the meets available, and have even won a few medals for placing in meets in the past. But what is important to me is that I have been committed to this team and this sport for many years, and I plan to continue to do so in the years to come.</p>
