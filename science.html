                    <p>Science Olympiad is a nation-wide science competition where out of a team of 15, students work in groups of 2 or 3 in individual events, which each cover a specific science topic. These topics are tested on in depth, and most cover college-level content. Some events include astronomy, microbiology, projectile/fluid physics, and anatomy and physiology. The score each event earns is the place
                        the pair/group get in the event relative to all other competitors. The teams with the overall lowest scores move on to the next highest level of tournament. There are regional, state, and national level tournaments, as well as a few invitational (but still very competitive) tournaments that are used for practice. While regional tournaments do not need qualification, state and national tournaments require a specific team placement at the lower level tournament to qualify. For example, to qualify for the
                        NYS tournament, a team needs to place 1st to 6th place at the regional level out of 35-40 teams who compete in the tournament. These tournaments are extremely competitive, as each tournament's questions become progressively more difficult as the tournament's level increases, and the average team's skill becomes increasingly higher. In addition, the number of teams remains high, with Regionals having ~40 teams, States having 40-50 teams, and Nationals having 60+ teams.</p>

There were 3 major awards given (1st to 3rd), as well as approximately 30 honorable mentions.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 9th grade, I qualified for the Computer Science and Informatics Summer Research Experience (CSIRE) Program at Stony Brook University in its pilot year. Through that program, I worked under Dr. Daifeng Wang on a project about Lung Adenocarcinoma gene expression across different stages. The aim was to find a set of genes that, through a change in expression, would indicate what stage a specific type of lung cancer was, without having to image the body. Data was taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).</p>

                    <p><br>In the summer of 10th grade, I contacted Dr. Jingfang Ju, who allowed me to do research at his lab. This research pertained to microRNA, specifically miR-194-5p, and what targets it had in pancreatic cancer patients specifically. miR-194-5p appearance had been associated with other cancers, but its role in pancreatic cancer had yet to be researched thoroughly. I correlated gene expression with miR-194-5p expression from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PAAD) to give a list of predicted targets, along with their Pearson correlation coefficient. The predicted targets, along with their correlation score, were cross-referenced with a few different target prediction software's target predictions.</p>

This research pertained to lipid droplets and how they changed in the aging brain. Images were taken from mice brains of different ages, all stained with Perilipin 1, which targets lipid droplets and thus allows us to see them. I then analyzed lipid droplet number and distribution across ages using a program I wrote.</p>
