                    <p>The NYSSMA All-State Piano Showcase is a goal for pianists all over the state. The way to enter an audition for the showcase is that if you get a 100 on the highest level of NYSSMA piano (a New York piano test that occurs around March-April) and get a recommendation by your NYSSMA judge, you could enter an audition to the Piano Showcase. There were thousands of people who took NYSSMA piano level 6 (the hardest level), and only about 12 were picked to perform in the showcase, which took place in Rochester, New York.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I qualified for the NYSSMA All-State Piano Showcase in 9th grade and performed in 10th grade, being one of the youngest performers there. Although many others performing had college professors as their teacher, and have won many international piano competitions, I was just a normal piano player with a local teacher and had not won many piano competitions. It was an honor to stand next to many prodigious young performers.</p>

                    <p>The NYSSMA All-State Orchestra is a highly selective orchestra, with members chosen all over the state. To be considered, you need a perfect score on the highest level of NYSSMA for your instrument (a New York instrumental skill test that occurs around March-April) and get a recommendation by your NYSSMA judge. There were thousands of people who took NYSSMA level 6, and only about 100 were picked to perform in the orchestra, as well as around 100 alternates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I qualified to be an alternate for the NYSSMA All-State Orchestra in 11th grade and went to the conference in 12th grade. Considering that I was in one of the most competitive regions for NYSSMA, and only a select portion of people were selected per region, I am quite honored to have qualified as even an alernate.</p>

                    <p>SPTF, or Suffolk Piano Teachers' Foundation, is a county-wide piano teachers foundation. They host a piano competition for all their students, with divisions ranging from Elementary (the easiest) to Late Advanced (the most difficult). Each division has about 20 people, of which 3 are winners.</p>
                	<br>
                    <p>In 9th grade, I tied for 3rd place in the Late Advanced division. As I was the youngest in the division, it was very difficult to win anything, especially since another person in the division played the same piece that I did. Yet I still managed to earn myself a spot at the SPTF awards ceremony.</p>

                    <p>MYO, or Metropolitan Youth Orchestra, is an orchestra of pre-college students from all over New York, and has some of the best musicians in the area. Every 2 summers they host a tour, where anyone who qualified to be in MYO can come with them to play around the world.</p>
                    <p>I qualified for MYO's Symphony Orchestra (the middle of 3 levels) in 7th grade. With the Symphony Orchestra, I played in halls such as the Staller Center at Stony Brook University, Tilles Center at LIU Post, and Lincoln Center in NYC.</p>
					<p>In the summer of 8th grade, the location of the MYO tour was Spain. My brother and I traveled around Spain, performing for hundreds to thousands of people at a time in places from a music hall to a church. It was an enlightening experience for me, to play with a talented orchestra all around Spain and perform in front of many wonderful Spanish people.</p>
					<p>In 10th grade, I went with the MYO tour, this time in Eastern Europe, across cities like Berlin. Prague, Vienna, and Budapest, again performing in front of thousands of people in each venue. Being able to see the beautiful sights of Eastern Europe, as well as seeing music history and performing in grand concert venues was truly a unique experience, and one I likely won't forget.</p>
					<p>11th grade was the year I qualified for MYO's Principal Orchestra, the highest orchestra in MYO. Through the Principal Orchestra, not only did I get to play in the same venues as with the Symphony Orchestra, but we additionally got to play in Carnegie Hall at the end of the year.</p>
