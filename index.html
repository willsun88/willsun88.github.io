                            My name is William Sun, and I'm a student at Ward Melville High School. I have been interested in computer programming, science, and math for many years. I have competed and won awards in many areas from sports to academics. I firmly believe in the power of reasoning and logic, yet emotion plays a crucial role in creativity and connecting to the human soul; thus, I aim to strengthen my emotional connection as well as my knowledge.
